Codes for "Inter-Region Affinity Distillation for Road Marking Segmentation"

## Requirements
- [PyTorch 0.3.0](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)
- Opencv
- cvbase

## Before start

Please follow [list](./list) to put ApolloScape in the desired folder. We'll call the directory that you cloned Codes-for-IntRA-KD as `$IntRA_KD_ROOT .

## Testing

1. Obtain model predictions from trained weights:

Download the trained [ResNet-101](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16TJW4K69uSb_ChBlbqX33aJ7LP43dhKf) and [ERFNet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=145B-xNl89R7H9qEZ6r8TzK-KSG6jf0Dp), and put them in the folder ```trained_model```.
```
    cd $IntRA_KD_ROOT
    sh test_pspnet_multi_scale.sh # sh test_erfnet_multi_scale.sh
```

The output predictions will be saved to ```road05_tmp``` by default.

2. Transfer TrainID to ID:
```
    python road_npy2img.py
```

The outputs will be stored in ```road05``` by default. 

3. Generate zip files:
```
    mkdir test
    mv road05 test/
    zip -r test.zip test
```

Now, just upload test.zip to [ApolloScape online server](http://apolloscape.auto/submit.html). The trained ResNet-101 can achieve **46.63%** mIoU and trained ERFNet can achieve **43.48%** mIoU.


4. (Optional) Produce color maps from model predictions:
```
    python trainId2color.py
```

5. (Optional) Leverage t-SNE to visualize the feature maps:

Please use the [script](https://github.com/cardwing/Codes-for-Steering-Control/blob/master/tools/draw_tsne.py) to perform the visualization.
 
## Training
```
    cd $IntRA_KD_ROOT
    sh train_pspnet.sh # sh train_erfnet_vanilla.sh
```

Please make sure that you have 8 GPUs and each GPU has least 11 GB memory if you want to train ResNet-101.
